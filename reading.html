<div class="title"> Notes on Blindness </div>

<div class="body1">
A documentary, dramatic adaptation of writer John Hulls descent into blindness. <br> He starts to make a diary
on audio cassettes as an outlet for the immense <br>change he is going through.
<br>
<br>
The film has three chapters; the first is visual memory and the construction of <br>
self. The second is the struggle with acceptance, wondering whether peace can <br> truly
be found in blindness and the third is a celebration of sensations which is a <br> part
of the piece presented as the reading.

  The tapes record grief but also renewal and a new sense of vision. I think it <br>
  is very hard to lose sight, after having it, being able to see, and that being <br>
   taken away feels like a deeper loss than not having sight at all.

  The cinematography adds so much depth to the narration. The soft blur, the tactile <br>
  sound design, the attention to textural detail makes everything so visceral, it feels <br>
  like you are going along with the experience that is being narrated and are present. <br>
  It goes to show not only how important visuals are to design/cinema but sound is something <br>
  that allows for space and dimension to be created. Another aspect narrated in the film itself. <br>

    "is the loss of the image of the face tied to the loss of self; you start to feel like <br>
    a spirit in existence"

    "rain is like a continuous blanket of differentiated but <br>
    specialised sound. Uninterrupted. If only there was something <br>
    like rain falling inside - so the room would take dimension"
    </div>

    <div class="body4">
    You see from the narration that John Hull functions better with familiarity, <br>
    his memory. Do you think people require predictability and stability to function <br>
    normally or at their best? How does a fixed and ever changing environment affect <br>
    your abilties, and in what ways?
<br>
<br>
Even though the brain is such an adapting organ we seem <br>
to live and thrive in familiarity.
<br>
<br>
Do you think in design familiarity and a stable nature are too prominent in terms of <br>
designing for the able, such as designing for peple with vision. And we should be <br>
venturing out of that stability and make more for the unfamiliar, the unable? Because <br>
isn't that a part of design, to help, solve, create?
